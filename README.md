I set up the repo using IntelliJ's built-in features. 

I then used the boilerplate Java with Maven option found under the Actions page. I had to change the Java version specified from '11' to '18'. 

In the pom.xml file I had to specify the surefire plugin as well as include the test directory for it to work. If I didn't do that it would not.
