# oblig3
I set up the repo using IntelliJ's built-in features. 

I then used the boilerplate Java with Maven option found under the Actions page. I had to change the Java version specified from '11' to '18'. 

I'm unable to get the tests to run. I've tried adding a dependency to the maven surefire plugin in the poml.xml file. As well as a dependency to junit-platform-sure-provider. Not sure what that last one is supposed to do. But there's not a lot of information out there about this problem. I've read it could be IntelliJ's fault when setting up the repo but I'd rather not have to troubleshoot that.
