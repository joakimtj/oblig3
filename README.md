# oblig3
First I set up the repo using IntelliJ, then I set up the .yml file on github using the boilerplate Java with Maven github provides. I only had to change the version of Java that came with the boilerplate code. (From 11 to 18.)
From there I tried a lot of different things but I could not get it to run the tests. I've tried adding surefire as a dependency to the poml.xml, tried refactoring the folders in the project but no matter what it does not detect the tests.
